# Cell Culture Training Simulator
*New equipment or devices for teaching cell culture skills*  
Monash University Engineering Final Year Project

## Project Description
Cell culture is a highly-technical process, which involves not just a good understanding of theory but also psychomotor skills that must be developed through practice. Cell culture training is currently done through supervised practice using "live conditions" i.e. using the same equipment as what is used for experiments. 
  
It is difficult for students to become proficient due to lack of access to equipment, and training sessions result in a huge workload for those that supervise the training. Undertrained researchers may be responsible for contamination of cultures with bacteria, which in some cases results in the loss of months of work.  
  
We would like to develop a simulated training system, where students can practice and ideally receive feedback on their skills in a low-risk environment. While this could involve virtual/augmented reality, it also seems important to involve a physical training station, to develop the psychomotor skills mentioned earlier. This might be equipped with various sensors to monitor the trainee's movement and provide feedback to them and the trainer.  
  
If successful, we anticipate that this would be implemented within Monash and potentially could be commercially viable as a standalone product.
